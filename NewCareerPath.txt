The Journey Phase and Transition to a New Career path.
How it All Began
It was a tiring day for me and so I returned home heavy and just wanted to sleep. Not long after I’d tucked myself into bed, a new message popped up on my Itel phone device. It was Tobi. An ex whom we’d broken up clean, and without grudges. Reason why his contact remained on my phone still. 
“Iyanu, how far na, I miss you ooo”
It read.
Egbami, I thought this guy is married already. How can you be missing an ex, while you’re married. Bemused and curious, I made to reply him. On a normal day, I would have just ignored it till some other time when I would’nt be this tired.
